TRANSLATORS

This file explains the rules to follow for translating regular expressions:

- Do not add extra spaces.
- MAKE SURE 'fuzzy' translations are reviewed, and if the translation is valid,
  remove the fuzzy line, otherwise the translation is ignored.
- Do not remove the vertical separator or pipe ('|') in strings containing
  it. Only the elements separated by this character are translated. 
  
  If the English string includes "|" but the translated string doesn't have
  more than one word, then you will have to remove "|". Also, the opposite, if
  the English string doesn't include "|" but the translated string is translated 
  to more than one word, then include "|" to separate them. For example,
  in Spanish:

  "next" would be translated to "siguiente|proxima|próxima"

  If you understand Spanish, you will notice that "proxima" is misspelled, the
  idea here is to support spelling errors (that make sense). In this case we
  are ignoring the 'ó' to allow the spelling error. 
  As a recommendation include the translations that would make sense.

TRANSLATABLE EXPRESSIONS

The following table shows the tokens and the meaning of them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Token | English words           | Description                | Translatable? |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| M     | "Jan|January|Feb|..."   | Short and long months.     | No            |
| D     | "Sun|Sunday|Mon|..."    | Short and long weekdays.   | No            |
| A     | "d/m/y|d-m-y"           | Date separated             | No            |
| T     | "today", "tomorrow"     | Same.                      | Yes           |
| O     | "1st,2nd,3rd,11th,.."   | Ordinal number             | No            |
| N     | "1,2,3,11,.."           | Cardinal number.           | No            |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| u     | "due|due by|due before" | Same                       | Yes           |
| d     | "day|days"              | Same                       | Yes           |
| w     | "week|weeks"            | Same                       | Yes           |
| m     | "month|months"          | Same                       | Yes           |
| y     | "year|years"            | Same                       | Yes           |
| n     | "next"                  | Same                       | Yes           |
| o     | "on"                    | Same                       | Yes           |
| i     | "in"                    | Same                       | Yes           |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Token "O", *only* lists the valid suffixes when using ordinal numbers,
for example, in English, valid ordinal numbers are:
- 1st
- 2nd
- 3rd
- 4th
- ..

So, all valid ordinal suffixes are: "st,nd,rd,th". If we wanted to translate 
this to Spanish the translation will be:

"o"

since all ordinal numbers in Spanish use the "o" suffix to indicate a cordinal
number:

- 1o
- 2o
- 3o
- ...

TRANSLATING REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

Regular expressions are usually defined by several tokens, for example,
the following regular expression in English:

"u M O"

In this regular expression we are using the tokens "u" "M" and "O", so the
following tasks would be valid (See the table for reference):

"due" "April" "2nd"
"due by" "Apr" "2nd"
"due before" "Apr" "2nd"

If we want to translate this to Spanish, we will have to, first, translate
the tokens that need translation, in this case only "u" token:

u = "para|antes de|antes|antes del"

After translating the token, we will have to translate the expression.
You will have to adapt the expression: add new words or move words,
to make sure the expression matches the task.

For example in Spanish, dates are "Day Month" not "Month Day", also you have to
use the word 'de' to join the Month and the Day. The final translated regular
expression would be

"u O 'de' M"

This will match:

"antes del" "1o" de "Abril"
