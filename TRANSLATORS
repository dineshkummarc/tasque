TRANSLATORS

This file explains the rules to follow for translating regular expressions.
The most important one is:

- Do not remove the the vertical separator or pipe ('|') in strings containing
  it. Only the elements separated by this character are translated.
- Do not add extra spaces. 
- MAKE SURE 'fuzzy' translations are reviewed, and if the translation is valid,
  remove the fuzzy line.

For example:

    "next" would be translated to spanish "siguiente|proxima|próxima"

Notice that "proxima" is also used, the idea here is to be not too strict
and support spelling errors (that make sense). In this case we are ignoring
the 'ó' to allow the spelling error.

TRANSLATABLE EXPRESSIONS

The following table shows the tokens and the meaning of them.

-------------------------------------------------------------
| Token | English words           | Description
-------------------------------------------------------------
| M     | "Jan|January|Feb|..."   | Short and long months.
| D     | "Sun|Sunday|Mon|..."    | Short and long weekdays.
| A     | "d/m/y|d-m-y"           | Date separated, locale specific
| T     | "today", "tomorrow"     | Same.
| O     | "1st,2nd,3rd,11th,.."   | Ordinal number
| N     | "1,2,3,11,.."           | Cardinal number, beginning in 1.

| u     | "due|due by|due before" | Same
| d     | "day|days"              | Same
| w     | "week|weeks"            | Same
| m     | "month|months"          | Same
| y     | "year|years"            | Same
| n     | "next"                  | Same
| o     | "on"                    | Same
| i     | "in"                    | Same

For example, the following expression:
"u M O" in English will match: "due by April 2nd"

but in Spanish this expression would need to be changed to:
"u O 'de' M" to match "antes del 1o de Abril"

also notice here that the all tokens are shortcuts to the translation
and only extra words needed are required to be included in the 
translated regular expression.
